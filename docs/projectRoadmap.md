# Project Roadmap

## High-Level Goals
- [x] Core log generation functionality
- [x] Multiple module support (web_server, database, api, etc.)
- [x] Multi-threading capability
- [x] Progress tracking with Docker-style display
- [x] LLM training format support
- [x] JSON output mode
- [x] Rich UI support (with fallback)
- [x] Configuration file management
- [x] Smart home device support
- [x] Comprehensive error handling
- [x] File cleanup strategies
- [x] Test coverage

## Current Goals
- [ ] Improve test coverage beyond current level
- [ ] Add more realistic log patterns
- [ ] Enhance smart home device support
- [ ] Add log analysis capabilities
- [ ] Implement log pattern validation
- [ ] Add support for custom log formats
- [ ] Create more comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add visualization capabilities for generated logs
- [ ] Implement log correlation features
- [ ] Add support for distributed log generation

## Completed Tasks
1. Initial project setup and structure
2. Core module implementation
3. Multi-threading support
4. Progress tracking system
5. Configuration management
6. LLM format generation
7. Smart home module implementation
8. Error handling system
9. File cleanup functionality
10. Basic test coverage
